\title{Read and Filter 10X Genomics Data with Gene Symbol Unification}
\usage{
read_10x_genefilter(filename, data_path, features_filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character string specifying the sample name. Used as a prefix
for cell barcodes and as the project name in the Seurat object.}

\item{data_path}{Character string specifying the directory containing 10X data files
(matrix.mtx, barcodes.tsv, and features file).}

\item{features_filename}{Character string specifying the name of the features file
(e.g., "features.tsv.gz" or "genes.tsv") within \code{data_path}.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[Seurat]{SeuratObject}} containing filtered and gene-unified count data.
        Cell barcodes are prefixed with \code{filename}, and gene symbols are used as row names.
}
\description{
Processes 10X Genomics scRNA-seq data by reading count matrices and feature annotations,
ensuring unique gene symbol representation. Filters out low-quality cells and genes,
while resolving duplicate gene symbols by retaining the highest expressed transcript.
