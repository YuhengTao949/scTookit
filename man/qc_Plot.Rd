\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing the QC metric to visualize}

\item{colname}{Column name (as string) of the QC metric to plot on y-axis}

\item{Breaks}{Sequence of breaks for y-axis (default: seq(0, 100, by = 5))}

\item{violin_color}{Color of violin outline (default: "steelblue")}

\item{violin_fill}{Fill color of violin (default: "lightblue")}

\item{box_fill}{Fill color of boxplot (default: "white")}

\item{point_color}{Color of jittered points (default: "darkblue")}

\item{violin_side}{Side to draw violin ("r" = right, "l" = left, default: "r")}

\item{nudge_amount}{Horizontal nudge amount for violin position (default: 0.2)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying the QC metric distribution with:
  - Half violin plot showing density distribution
  - Boxplot showing quartiles
  - Jittered points representing individual cells
  - Dashed red line indicating automatic threshold cutoff
}
\description{
Creates a customized violin plot with boxplot and jittered points for visualizing
a single quality control metric. Includes automatic threshold line based on
distribution characteristics.
